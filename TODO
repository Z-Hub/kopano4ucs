Goal is to install the Kopano integration package on UCS, but have Kopano running separately.

- kopano4ucs -> make it a metapackage
- new package to have app relevant parts of old kopano4ucs - kopano4ucs-app?
- ~~new package to have non-app relevant parts (when kopano is running separately)~~
  - users can now install just kopano4ucs-udm to have just the udm integration

- [x] remodel multiserver package
  - have one package for pure multiserver
  - have one package for archiver multiserver

- listener needs mechanism to trigger actions on remote server
  - for user creation/modification
  - ~~for ucr modification~~

- [x] Rename 71kopano4ucs-uninstall.uinst to 71kopano4ucs.uinst ? 
  - uninstall is "duplicated"
