The Debian Package kopano4ucs
----------------------------

In certain setups the Univention Corporate Server UCS is running as
central LDAP- and authentication service. Other services use this LDAP
to retrieve information about users.

In case you want to use Univention Corporate Server UCS as an LDAP
server for a separate Kopano server installation or within a Kopano
multiserver setup, you'll need the LDAP schema extension and a
corresponding UDM extension.

Kopano4UCS is a maintained bunch of packages for UCS, but
unfortunately the LDAP and UDM extensions are mixed in the binary
packages. When installing these packages you'll end up with a full
running Kopano service including SQL database on the Univention server.

If this is not what you want, this package might be the one you're
looking for.

Based on the original Kopano LDAP schema taken from the Kopano4UCS
packages, the neccessary UDM intergration including hook mechanisms to
run actions on the Kopano server are built together in this package.
